# Prediction Service

## Overview

The Prediction Service is a future microservice designed to handle ML model predictions and inference for the Smart Maintenance SaaS platform.

## Purpose

This service will be responsible for:

- **ML Model Loading**: Loading trained models from MLflow registry
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocessing and transforming input data
- **Model Inference**: Executing ML model predictions
- **Result Formatting**: Standardizing prediction outputs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking model performance metrics
- **A/B Testing**: Supporting model variant testing

## Current Status

**⚠️ PLACEHOLDER SERVICE ⚠️**

This service is currently a scaffolding placeholder created as part of the microservice migration strategy. It should **NOT** be deployed to production.

## Migration Trigger

This service should be activated when the following conditions from `MICROSERVICE_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` are met:

- P95 latency for `/api/v1/ml/predict` exceeds 50ms
- Main API container consistently uses >80% CPU/Memory due to ML workloads
- Formation of dedicated ML engineering team
- Need for independent ML deployment lifecycle

## Future Implementation

When activated, this service will include:

- Integration with MLflow model registry
- Feature engineering pipeline
- Model caching and optimization
- Distributed inference capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms

## API Endpoints

### Current Placeholder Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /predict` - Model prediction (placeholder implementation)

### Future Planned Endpoints

- `GET /models` - List available models
- `POST /models/{model_name}/predict` - Model-specific predictions
- `GET /models/{model_name}/info` - Model metadata
- `POST /models/batch-predict` - Batch prediction processing
- `GET /metrics` - Service performance metrics

## Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Build the container
docker build -t prediction-service .

# Run locally
docker run -p 8001:8001 prediction-service

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Integration with Main Application

This service is designed to integrate with the main Smart Maintenance SaaS application through:

- Service discovery and registration
- Shared MLflow registry access
- Consistent logging and monitoring
- Standardized API contracts

## Security Considerations

- Non-root container execution
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Secure model artifact access
- Audit logging for predictions

## Monitoring and Observability

Future implementation will include:

- Prometheus metrics for performance monitoring
- Distributed tracing integration
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Error rate and latency alerting
