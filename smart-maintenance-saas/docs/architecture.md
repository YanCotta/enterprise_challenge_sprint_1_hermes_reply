# Smart Maintenance SaaS - Architecture

## 1. Overview

The Smart Maintenance SaaS platform employs a microservices-inspired, event-driven architecture centered around a multi-agent system. This design promotes modularity, scalability, and resilience. Core components communicate asynchronously via an Event Bus, allowing for decoupled services and flexible workflow orchestration.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1. API Gateway (FastAPI)

* **Purpose:** Serves as the primary entry point for all external interactions (UI, third-party systems).
* **Responsibilities:** Request validation, authentication, authorization, routing to appropriate internal services/agents.
* **Technology:** FastAPI.

### 2.2. Event Bus

* **Purpose:** Facilitates asynchronous communication between agents and other services.
* **Responsibilities:** Manages event subscriptions and publications. Ensures reliable event delivery (initially in-memory, with plans for Kafka/Redis for persistence and scalability).
* **Implementation:** `core.events.event_bus.EventBus`.
* **Key Events:** (Refer to Event Catalog in `smart-maintenance-saas/README.md`)
  * `BaseEventModel`
  * `SensorDataReceivedEvent`
  * `DataProcessedEvent`
  * `AnomalyDetectedEvent`
  * `AnomalyValidatedEvent`
  * `MaintenancePredictedEvent`
  * `MaintenanceScheduledEvent`
  * `AgentStatusUpdateEvent`
  * `HumanDecisionRequiredEvent`
  * `HumanDecisionResponseEvent`

### 2.3. Agent System

The heart of the platform, consisting of specialized agents built upon a common base.

* **`BaseAgent` (`apps.agents.base_agent.BaseAgent`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Abstract base class providing foundational capabilities for all agents.
  * **Responsibilities:**
    * Lifecycle management (`start`, `stop`).
    * Core event handling (`handle_event`, `_publish_event`).
    * Capability registration and advertisement.
    * Health status reporting (`get_health`).
  * **Key Methods:** `process` (abstract, for agent-specific logic), `register_capabilities`, `start`, `stop`, `handle_event`, `get_health`.

* **`AgentRegistry` (`core.agent_registry.AgentRegistry`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Singleton service for discovering and managing active agent instances.
  * **Responsibilities:** Allows agents to register themselves and other components to look up agents by ID.

* **`HumanInterfaceAgent` (`apps.agents.interface.human_interface_agent.HumanInterfaceAgent`)**:
  * **Purpose:** Simulates human-in-the-loop decision points for critical maintenance scenarios requiring human judgment.
  * **Responsibilities:**
    * Subscribes to `HumanDecisionRequiredEvent` from other agents (typically the future `OrchestratorAgent`).
    * Simulates intelligent human decision-making based on decision type and contextual information.
    * Publishes `HumanDecisionResponseEvent` with decisions, reasoning, and additional context.
    * Supports multiple decision types: maintenance approval, priority assignment, resource allocation, and safety overrides.
  * **Key Features:**
    * **Decision Simulation Logic:** Applies appropriate decision-making algorithms based on the decision type and context provided.
    * **Comprehensive Logging:** Provides detailed logging of all decision requests, processing steps, and responses for audit trails.
    * **Event Correlation:** Maintains correlation IDs to track decision requests through the entire workflow.
    * **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles malformed requests and unknown decision types with appropriate fallback responses.
  * **Future Enhancement:** In production, this agent would be replaced or augmented with actual human interface components (web dashboards, mobile apps, notification systems) for real human decision-making.

* **Specialized Agents (Examples - to be expanded):**
  * `DataAcquisitionAgent`: Ingests data from various sources.
  * `AnomalyDetectionAgent`: Analyzes data for anomalies.
  * `ValidationAgent`: Validates and enriches anomaly alerts.
  * `LearningAgent`: RAG-based knowledge management and learning from system feedback.
  * `PredictionAgent`: Provides predictive maintenance recommendations using ML.
  * `SchedulingAgent`: Optimizes maintenance task scheduling and technician assignments.
  * `NotificationAgent`: Sends notifications through multiple channels (console, email, SMS, etc.) based on maintenance scheduling events and other system events.
  * `ReportingAgent`: Generates analytics reports with data visualization and actionable insights for maintenance operations.
  * `HumanInterfaceAgent`: Simulates human-in-the-loop decision points for critical maintenance decisions requiring human judgment.
  * (More agents for learning, decision support, etc.)

### 2.4. Data Persistence Layer

* **Purpose:** Stores all relevant data, including sensor readings, asset information, anomalies, and maintenance tasks.
* **Technologies:**
  * **PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB:** For efficient storage and querying of time-series sensor data. Hypertables are used for `sensor_readings`.
  * **SQLAlchemy:** ORM for interacting with the database.
  * **Alembic:** For database schema migrations.
* **Key ORM Models:** (`core.database.orm_models`)
  * `SensorReadingORM`
  * `AnomalyAlertORM`
  * `MaintenanceTaskORM`

### 2.5. Configuration Management

* **Purpose:** Manages application settings.
* **Technology:** Pydantic `BaseSettings` (`core.config.settings.Settings`).
* **Source:** Environment variables and `.env` files.

### 2.6. Logging

* **Purpose:** Provides structured, centralized logging.
* **Technology:** `python-json-logger` (`core.logging_config.py`).

## 3. Data Flow (Example: Sensor Data Ingestion & Anomaly Detection)

1. **Ingestion:** External system (or simulator) sends sensor data to the `/api/v1/ingestion/sensor-reading/` endpoint on the FastAPI API Gateway.
2. **API Handling:** The API Gateway validates the request and might publish a raw data event or directly call the `DataAcquisitionAgent`.
3. **Data Acquisition:** The `DataAcquisitionAgent` receives the data.
   * It validates, cleans, and potentially enriches the data (e.g., adding asset context).
   * It publishes a `SensorDataReceivedEvent` (or `DataProcessedEvent`) to the Event Bus.
   * It stores the processed sensor reading in the TimescaleDB via `CRUDSensorReading`.
4. **Anomaly Detection:** An `AnomalyDetectionAgent`, subscribed to `SensorDataReceivedEvent` (or `DataProcessedEvent`), receives the new data.
   * It applies its anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., threshold checks, statistical models).
   * If an anomaly is detected, it publishes an `AnomalyDetectedEvent` to the Event Bus.
   * It stores the anomaly details in the database via `CRUDAnomalyAlert`.
5. **Further Processing:** Other agents (e.g., `NotificationAgent`, `MaintenanceSchedulerAgent`) can subscribe to `AnomalyDetectedEvent` to trigger further actions like sending alerts or creating maintenance tasks.

### 3.1. Notification Flow (Maintenance Scheduling Events)

1. **Maintenance Scheduling:** The `SchedulingAgent` processes maintenance requests and publishes a `MaintenanceScheduledEvent` to the Event Bus with scheduling details.
2. **Notification Handling:** The `NotificationAgent`, subscribed to `MaintenanceScheduledEvent`, receives the event.
   * It creates a `NotificationRequest` with appropriate message content based on scheduling success/failure.
   * It uses template rendering to format maintenance details (equipment ID, technician, timing, etc.).
3. **Multi-Channel Delivery:** The agent uses configured notification providers to deliver notifications:
   * `ConsoleNotificationProvider`: For development/testing (prints to console).
   * Future providers: Email, SMS, WhatsApp, Slack for production use.
4. **Result Tracking:** Each notification attempt returns a `NotificationResult` with delivery status, timing, and error details if applicable.

### 3.2. Human-in-the-Loop Decision Flow

The `HumanInterfaceAgent` facilitates critical decision points requiring human judgment:

1. **Decision Request:** Any agent (typically the future `OrchestratorAgent`) publishes a `HumanDecisionRequiredEvent` to the Event Bus when encountering a situation requiring human input.
2. **Decision Processing:** The `HumanInterfaceAgent`, subscribed to `HumanDecisionRequiredEvent`, receives the request.
   * It logs the decision request with all contextual information.
   * It simulates human decision-making based on the decision type and context.
   * It applies appropriate decision logic (approval/rejection for maintenance decisions, priority assignment for scheduling, etc.).
3. **Response Publication:** The agent publishes a `HumanDecisionResponseEvent` with:
   * The decision outcome (approved/rejected/modified).
   * Reasoning and justification for the decision.
   * Any additional context or instructions.
4. **Workflow Continuation:** Requesting agents receive the response and continue their workflows based on the human decision.

**Decision Types Supported:**
* `MAINTENANCE_APPROVAL`: Critical maintenance task approval/rejection
* `PRIORITY_ASSIGNMENT`: Task priority level determination
* `RESOURCE_ALLOCATION`: Resource assignment decisions
* `SAFETY_OVERRIDE`: Safety-critical override decisions

## 5. Machine Learning Considerations

### 5.1. Model Lifecycle and Training Strategy

#### Current Implementation Limitations

The current implementation of the `AnomalyDetectionAgent` includes simplifications suitable for initial development and testing, but with known limitations for production use:

**StandardScaler Fitting:**

* Currently re-fits (`fit_transform`) on individual incoming `DataProcessedEvent` features
* For single data points, this normalizes only to that specific point (mean=0, std=1)
* Lacks stable baseline for "normal" data distribution needed for effective scaling

**IsolationForest Training:**

* Trained (`fit`) using scaled features from the very first `DataProcessedEvent`
* Model's definition of "normal" behavior based on single, potentially unrepresentative data point
* Results in poor generalization and unreliable anomaly detection

#### Why Current Simplifications Are Not Ideal for Production

1. **Lack of Representativeness:** Models trained on isolated or first-encountered data points cannot learn the true underlying distribution of normal operational data. This leads to poor generalization and unreliable anomaly detection.

2. **No Baseline for Normality:** The StandardScaler needs to be fitted on a dataset representing normal behavior to learn its mean and standard deviation. These learned parameters are then used to transform new data, comparing it against that established baseline.

3. **Model Instability:** The IsolationForest model will be highly unstable and biased if trained on insufficient or non-representative data.

4. **Ignoring Sensor Specificity:** Different sensors, even of the same type, can have unique operating profiles. A model trained on data from one sensor (or the first encountered data from any sensor) may not be appropriate for others.

5. **Inefficiency:** While not a major concern with single data points, repeatedly fitting models is computationally more expensive than fitting once and then predicting many times.

#### A More Robust Approach for Production

**Offline Training Phase:**

1. **Data Collection:** Curate a substantial historical dataset that accurately represents normal operating conditions for various sensors or equipment types. This dataset should be large enough to capture typical variations.

2. **Data Labeling (Optional but Recommended):** If possible, label periods of known anomalies in your historical data. This is crucial for evaluation but not strictly for unsupervised models like Isolation Forest (which learns from unlabelled, assumed-normal data).

3. **Preprocessing:** Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers if they are not the target anomalies for this specific model).

4. **Model Fitting:**

   * **StandardScaler:** Fit the scaler on the entire normal training dataset for each sensor type (or group) to learn its characteristic mean and variance.
   * **IsolationForest:** Train the IsolationForest model on the scaled normal training dataset.

5. **Model Serialization & Registry:** Save (serialize) the fitted scalers and trained models (e.g., using joblib or pickle). Store these in a model registry (like MLflow, or a structured file storage like S3) versioned and accessible by the AnomalyDetectionAgent.

**Online Prediction Phase (in AnomalyDetectionAgent):**

1. **Model Loading:** On startup, or when processing data for a specific sensor type for the first time, the agent should load the appropriate pre-trained scaler and Isolation Forest model from the registry.

2. **Transform:** Use the loaded (and already fitted) StandardScaler to transform (not fit_transform) the features of new incoming sensor data.

3. **Predict:** Feed the scaled features to the loaded (and already trained) IsolationForest model to get predict() and decision_function() outputs.

**Sensor-Specific Models:**

* Maintain separate scalers and models for different sensor types (e.g., temperature_scaler.joblib, temperature_iforest.joblib).
* The AnomalyDetectionAgent would select the correct model files based on the sensor_type (or even sensor_id for highly critical/unique sensors) of the incoming SensorReading.
* The historical_data_store approach for the statistical model is a good parallel for managing parameters/models per sensor.

**Periodic Retraining and Monitoring (MLOps):**

* Implement a strategy for periodically retraining models using fresh data to adapt to evolving equipment behavior (concept drift).
* Monitor model performance in production (using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score if feedback/labels are available) to identify when retraining is necessary.

### 5.2. Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score

To evaluate the effectiveness of the AnomalyDetectionAgent, especially once it's more mature or if you have labeled data (knowing actual past anomalies), you can use standard classification metrics:

**Classification Framework:**

* **True Positive (TP):** An actual anomaly that the agent correctly flagged as an anomaly.
* **False Positive (FP):** A normal data point that the agent incorrectly flagged as an anomaly (a false alarm).
* **True Negative (TN):** A normal data point that the agent correctly identified as normal.
* **False Negative (FN):** An actual anomaly that the agent failed to detect and flagged as normal (a missed detection).

Based on these, the key metrics are:

#### Precision

* **Formula:** TP / (TP + FP)
* **In Context:** "Of all the alerts our AnomalyDetectionAgent generated, what percentage were actual equipment problems?"
* **Significance:** High precision minimizes wasted resources spent investigating false alarms and builds trust in the system.

#### Recall (or Sensitivity)

* **Formula:** TP / (TP + FN)
* **In Context:** "Of all the actual equipment problems that occurred, what percentage did our AnomalyDetectionAgent successfully detect?"
* **Significance:** High recall is crucial for a predictive maintenance system, as the primary goal is to catch impending failures. Missed detections (FN) can lead to unexpected downtime and higher costs.

#### F1-score

* **Formula:** 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
* **In Context:** A single metric that provides a balance between Precision and Recall.
* **Significance:** Useful when there's a trade-off. For instance, being extremely sensitive to catch all anomalies (high recall) might lead to more false alarms (lower precision). The F1-score helps find a good compromise.

#### How These Metrics Would Be Used

**Model Selection & Tuning:** When experimenting with different anomaly detection algorithms or tuning parameters (like the contamination factor in Isolation Forest or the sigma value in the statistical model), these metrics, calculated on a labeled validation dataset, would guide decisions.

**Performance Monitoring:** If a feedback mechanism is in place (e.g., maintenance logs confirming if an alert corresponded to a real issue), these metrics can be tracked over time to monitor the agent's performance in production and signal when models might need retraining or adjustment.

**Business Value Justification:** Correlating these metrics with operational costs (e.g., cost of a missed failure vs. cost of investigating a false alarm) can help in optimizing the system for business objectives.

### 5.3. Reporting and Analytics Flow

The `ReportingAgent` provides comprehensive analytics and visualization capabilities for maintenance operations:

#### Data Flow: Report Generation

1. **Report Request:** External systems or API endpoints trigger report generation by calling the `ReportingAgent.generate_report()` method directly.
2. **Analytics Processing:** The `AnalyticsEngine` component within the agent processes the request:
   * Analyzes request parameters (report type, time range, format requirements)
   * Generates mock analytics data appropriate for the report type (anomaly summary, maintenance overview, system health)
   * Calculates KPIs, metrics, and statistical summaries
3. **Chart Generation:** If charts are requested:
   * Creates matplotlib visualizations (line charts, bar charts, histograms)
   * Encodes charts as base64 strings for easy integration
   * Handles various chart types based on data characteristics
4. **Content Formatting:** Generates final report content:
   * **JSON Format:** Structured data with metadata, analytics summary, and embedded charts
   * **Text Format:** Human-readable reports with formatted metrics and equipment insights
5. **Report Assembly:** Combines all components into a `ReportResult` with:
   * Complete metadata (timestamps, correlation tracking, generation details)
   * Analytics summary with key metrics
   * Generated charts (if requested)
   * Formatted content appropriate for the target audience

#### Report Types Supported

* **Anomaly Summary Reports:** Analysis of detected anomalies with confidence distributions and equipment impact assessment
* **Maintenance Overview Reports:** Comprehensive maintenance metrics including task completion rates, technician utilization, and equipment uptime
* **System Health Reports:** Overall system performance with uptime metrics, data quality scores, and operational efficiency indicators

#### Integration Points

* **On-Demand Generation:** Direct API integration for real-time report requests
* **Scheduled Reporting:** Can be integrated with scheduling systems for regular report generation
* **Dashboard Integration:** JSON output optimized for consumption by dashboards and monitoring systems
* **Export Capabilities:** Text format suitable for email distribution and document generation

## 5.3. LearningAgent: RAG-Based Knowledge Management

The **LearningAgent** implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for continuous learning and knowledge management within the maintenance platform.

### Architecture

The LearningAgent utilizes two key technologies:

1. **ChromaDB**: A vector database that stores textual knowledge with semantic embeddings for efficient similarity search
2. **SentenceTransformers**: State-of-the-art language models that convert text into high-dimensional vector embeddings

### Core Capabilities

#### Knowledge Storage
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Converts textual content into vector representations using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model
- **Metadata Association**: Stores rich metadata alongside knowledge items (source, category, timestamp, etc.)
- **Persistent Storage**: Knowledge persists across agent restarts using ChromaDB's storage layer

#### Knowledge Retrieval
- **Semantic Search**: Finds relevant knowledge based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches
- **Similarity Scoring**: Returns cosine similarity scores to rank knowledge relevance
- **Configurable Results**: Adjustable number of results and similarity thresholds

#### Event-Driven Learning
- **SystemFeedbackReceivedEvent Subscription**: Automatically processes feedback events from other system components
- **Real-time Learning**: Immediately incorporates new feedback into the knowledge base
- **Structured Processing**: Validates feedback using Pydantic schemas before storage

### Integration with System Events

The LearningAgent subscribes to `SystemFeedbackReceivedEvent` and automatically:

1. **Validates** incoming feedback using the `FeedbackData` schema
2. **Enriches** metadata with event context (event ID, source agent, timestamps)
3. **Stores** feedback as searchable knowledge with semantic embeddings
4. **Logs** processing results for monitoring and debugging

### Error Handling and Resilience

- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even when ChromaDB or embedding models fail
- **Component Health Monitoring**: Provides detailed health status for all RAG components
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error reporting and operational logging
- **Robust Error Recovery**: Handles various failure scenarios without crashing

### Data Models

The agent uses three key Pydantic models:

- **FeedbackData**: Structures incoming feedback with validation
- **KnowledgeItem**: Represents retrieved knowledge with similarity scores
- **LearningResult**: Reports success/failure of knowledge operations

### Use Cases

1. **Historical Context**: Retrieve past maintenance experiences similar to current situations
2. **Best Practices**: Store and retrieve maintenance best practices and lessons learned
3. **Troubleshooting**: Access relevant troubleshooting guides based on current issues
4. **Continuous Learning**: Automatically learn from system feedback and operator inputs

## 6. Scalability and Resilience

* **Scalability:** Agents can be scaled independently. The Event Bus can be scaled out (e.g., using Kafka).
* **Resilience:** Decoupling via the Event Bus means failure in one agent doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system. Retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues can be implemented.

## 7. Future Considerations

* Persistent Event Bus (Kafka, Redis Streams).
* Service Discovery (Consul, etcd) if moving beyond a single-node deployment for agents.
* Distributed Tracing.
* More sophisticated Agent capabilities (learning, planning).

## 8. Architectural Evolution: Custom Foundation vs. Advanced Frameworks

### Strategic Implementation Approach

Our long-term architectural vision for the Smart Maintenance SaaS platform encompasses an "Enhanced Tech Stack" that includes powerful frameworks like **CrewAI**, **LangGraph**, and **Temporal.io**, along with advanced communication protocols such as **Google's A2A** and **Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. These technologies represent the cutting edge of multi-agent systems, workflow orchestration, and AI-powered collaboration.

However, our current implementation deliberately employs a custom, foundational approach built around:

- **Custom BaseAgent Class**: Provides core lifecycle management, event handling, and capability registration for all specialized agents
- **Custom EventBus**: Manages asynchronous, event-driven communication between agents using Pydantic-defined models for type safety and validation
- **Emergent Workflow Patterns**: System orchestration that emerges naturally from direct publish-subscribe relationships between agents

### Rationale: Why Custom Foundation First

This custom approach represents a **deliberate strategic decision** for our initial 14-day implementation sprint, driven by several key considerations:

#### 1. Accelerated Core Functionality Delivery
Building on a custom foundation allowed us to prioritize and rapidly develop the essential functional capabilities of individual agents—data acquisition, anomaly detection, validation, and predictive maintenance. Rather than investing significant time in framework integration, we could focus on delivering working AI and ML capabilities that demonstrate immediate business value.

#### 2. Maintained Development Momentum
Our approach builds upon the existing, battle-tested codebase without the disruption of integrating large new frameworks mid-sprint. This preserved development velocity during a critical timeline where proving core functionality was paramount.

#### 3. Managed Complexity Appropriately
Advanced frameworks like Temporal.io and LangGraph bring sophisticated capabilities but also introduce substantial architectural complexity. Deferring this complexity until we have a solid understanding of our specific orchestration needs reduces the risk of over-engineering and helps maintain project timeline commitments.

#### 4. Risk Mitigation
By establishing a working system first, we create a stable foundation that can be incrementally enhanced rather than risking a "big bang" integration approach that could compromise the entire deliverable.

### The Path Forward: Strategic Framework Integration

This custom foundation approach is **not an abandonment** of our architectural vision, but rather a pragmatic, phased evolution strategy:

#### Strategic Introduction Points

Advanced frameworks will be introduced strategically when their specific advantages solve clear, emergent problems identified through real system operation:

**The Orchestrator Agent (Day 10) as a Critical Decision Point**: The development of our planned OrchestratorAgent represents the natural inflection point to critically assess the system's orchestration needs. As workflow complexity grows beyond simple event chains, this is when dedicated engines like **Temporal.io** for robust workflow management or **LangGraph** for state-machine-based agent coordination will be rigorously evaluated.

#### Framework-Specific Adoption Criteria

**CrewAI Integration**: Will be considered when we develop complex, collaborative, LLM-powered agent teams that require sophisticated role assignment, task delegation, and collaborative reasoning capabilities beyond our current event-driven patterns.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Will be integrated when our agents require standardized, sophisticated "tool use" capabilities, particularly for LLM-based agents that need to interact with external systems, APIs, and databases in a structured, protocol-driven manner.

**Temporal.io**: Will be evaluated for complex, long-running workflows that require durability guarantees, advanced retry logic, versioning, and sophisticated state management beyond what our current EventBus provides.

**LangGraph**: Will be considered for agents requiring complex state machines, conditional branching, and sophisticated decision trees that go beyond simple publish-subscribe patterns.

#### Selective Adoption Philosophy

Rather than wholesale framework adoption, we will implement a **selective integration approach**:

1. **Proof of Concept Validation**: New frameworks will be validated through isolated proof-of-concept implementations
2. **Incremental Migration**: Critical components will be migrated gradually, maintaining system stability
3. **Hybrid Architecture**: We will maintain our custom components where they provide sufficient value while selectively upgrading high-complexity areas
4. **Continuous Evaluation**: Regular assessment of framework benefits against our evolving system complexity

### Summary: Pragmatic Evolution Strategy

Our architectural strategy balances **speed of delivery with long-term architectural excellence** through a pragmatic, iterative approach. We are building robust core features on our solid, custom foundation first, while systematically planning to incorporate specialized, advanced frameworks as our system's complexity and operational requirements evolve.

This approach ensures we deliver immediate business value while positioning the platform for sophisticated future capabilities. Rather than betting everything on framework selection upfront, we are letting real-world usage patterns and operational requirements guide our architectural evolution—a strategy that maximizes both short-term delivery success and long-term architectural soundness.

The result is a system that can demonstrate immediate ROI while maintaining the flexibility to evolve into a best-in-class, enterprise-grade platform leveraging the most appropriate advanced technologies for each specific challenge we encounter.
