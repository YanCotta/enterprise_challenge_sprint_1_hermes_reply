## 1. Executive Summary

This document details the successful conclusion of a foundational R&D sprint that established and validated the core machine learning capabilities of the Smart Maintenance SaaS platform. The sprint was divided into two main stages:
1.  **Initial Model Development (Days 9-10)**: Focused on building foundational anomaly detection and time-series forecasting models using synthetically generated data. This stage proved the viability of the core MLOps infrastructure.
2.  **Project Gauntlet (Days 11-12)**: A rigorous, multi-phase benchmark against five real-world, multi-modal industrial datasets. This validated the platform's versatility, robustness, and ability to produce production-ready models for diverse predictive maintenance tasks.

The project concludes with a portfolio of seven highly capable, registered "champion" models ready for integration into the platform's multi-agent system. The underlying Docker and MLflow infrastructure has been significantly hardened through comprehensive dependency resolution, build optimization (reducing Docker contexts from 23GB to ~5MB), and multi-stage containerization. The platform now demonstrates exceptional multi-modal capabilities, successfully processing tabular data, vibration signals, audio streams, and time-series data with sophisticated feature engineering pipelines.

## 3. Detailed Model Analysis & Comparison

This section provides a deeper dive into the outcomes of each modeling initiative.

### 3.1. Foundational Models (Synthetic Data)

#### **Time-Series Forecasting: Prophet vs. LightGBM**
* **Objective**: Forecast future sensor readings based on historical patterns.
* **Dataset**: Synthetically generated time-series data mimicking industrial sensors.
* **Analysis**: A tuned **Prophet** model was benchmarked against a **LightGBM** model that used lag features. The Prophet model demonstrated superior performance, achieving a **20.86% improvement** in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over a naive baseline, which was **9.68% better** than the LightGBM challenger.
* **Champion**: `prophet_forecaster_enhanced_sensor-001` was declared the winner due to its higher accuracy and specialized suitability for time-series decomposition.

#### **Anomaly Detection: IsolationForest**
* **Objective**: Detect unusual or anomalous readings in sensor data streams.
* **Dataset**: Synthetically generated sensor data with injected anomalies.
* **Analysis**: An `IsolationForest` model was trained to identify outliers. The development process focused heavily on hardening the MLOps pipeline, ensuring robust data preprocessing (intelligent forward/back-filling of missing values) and reliable, containerized training execution.
* **Champion**: `anomaly_detector_refined_v2` was registered as the foundational model for the platform's Anomaly Detection Agent.

### 3.2. Project Gauntlet (Real-World Datasets)

#### **Classification Gauntlet 1: AI4I Machine Failure**
* **Objective**: Predict machine failure from tabular process data.
* **Dataset**: [AI4I 2020 UCI Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset)
* **Analysis**: Six models were benchmarked. All models, including RandomForest, SVC, and LightGBM, achieved an exceptional **99.9% accuracy**. Critically, the 27 engineered features provided no measurable improvement, indicating a performance ceiling due to the high quality and clear separability of the dataset.
* **Champion**: `ai4i_classifier_randomforest_baseline` was selected for its simplicity and top-tier F1-score, proving that complex feature engineering is not always necessary.

#### **Classification Gauntlet 2: Kaggle Pump Maintenance**
* **Objective**: Test the generalizability of the classification pipeline on a new dataset.
* **Dataset**: [Kaggle Pump Sensor Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nphantawee/pump-sensor-data)
* **Analysis**: The pipeline was applied to a new pump sensor dataset, and all models achieved a **perfect 100% accuracy**. This outstanding result further confirmed the robustness of the training workflow and the high quality of the dataset.
* **Champion**: The `RandomForest_baseline` run is the champion, delivering perfect results with the simplest feature set.

#### **Vibration Gauntlet 1: NASA Bearing Anomaly Detection**
* **Objective**: Process raw vibration signals to detect bearing anomalies.
* **Dataset**: [NASA IMS Bearing Dataset](https://www.nasa.gov/intelligent-systems-division/discovery-and-systems-health/pcoe/pcoe-data-set-repository/)
* **Analysis**: A sophisticated signal processing pipeline was developed to extract 10 key features from the time and frequency domains (RMS, Peak-to-Peak, Kurtosis, Skewness, Crest Factor, FFT analysis with dominant frequency, spectral centroid, and high-frequency energy). The pipeline processed 20 files from 8-channel accelerometer data (4 bearings √ó 2 sensors) with 20kHz sampling, generating 2,880 feature windows. The `IsolationForest` model successfully identified a clear 10.0% anomaly rate, aligning with industry standards for bearing health monitoring.
* **Champion**: `vibration_anomaly_isolationforest` is the production-ready model for this task.

#### **Vibration Gauntlet 2: XJTU Run-to-Failure Analysis**
* **Objective**: Stress-test the vibration pipeline on a more complex, hierarchical dataset.
* **Dataset**: [XJTU-SY Bearing Datasets](https://biaoming.xjtu.edu.cn/szdw/list.htm)
* **Analysis**: The pipeline was successfully adapted to handle the complex multi-condition structure (35Hz12kN, 37.5Hz11kN, 40Hz10kN) and dual-channel (Horizontal/Vertical) signals of the XJTU dataset. Advanced feature extraction generated 22 features (11 per channel) from 180 CSV files across 11 unique bearing IDs, including statistical domain features (RMS, kurtosis, skewness, crest factor) and frequency domain analysis (FFT, spectral centroid, high-frequency energy). The `IsolationForest` model again proved effective with 10.0% anomaly detection, demonstrating the generalizability of our approach across different bearing datasets and operating conditions.
* **Champion**: `xjtu_anomaly_isolation_forest` is the champion for this advanced use case.

#### **Audio Gauntlet: MIMII Sound Classification**
* **Objective**: Classify machine sounds as normal or abnormal using audio processing.
* **Dataset**: [MIMII Sound Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3384388)
* **Analysis**: This phase validated the platform's multi-modal capabilities and required significant infrastructure hardening, including Docker build optimization (reducing contexts from 23GB to ~5MB through enhanced `.dockerignore`), multi-stage Dockerfile implementation, and resolution of complex dependency conflicts with `librosa` and system-level audio libraries. A comprehensive pipeline using `librosa` was built to process over 8,300 `.wav` files and extract MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features representing the unique "fingerprint" of each sound. The `RandomForestClassifier` achieved a strong **93.3% accuracy** with promising F1-Score of 0.62 for abnormal sound detection.
* **Champion**: `RandomForest_MIMII_Audio_Benchmark` and its associated `MIMII_Audio_Scaler` are the champions.

## 4. How to Use the MLflow Environment

The MLflow instance at `http://localhost:5000` is the central hub for all project models and experiments.

### **Navigating Experiments**
The **Experiments** tab is organized to reflect the project's history. Each of the five "Gauntlet" experiments contains all the runs, parameters, and artifacts for that phase. The descriptions have been updated to provide clear context for each.

### **Using Registered Models**
The **Models** tab contains the curated list of production-ready "champion" models.
* **Descriptions**: Each champion model has a detailed description outlining its purpose, dataset, and key performance metrics.
* **Tags**: Models are tagged for easy filtering by `Project`, `Phase`, `Task`, `Status`, and `Dataset`.
* **Deployment**: To use a model, load it from the registry by its name (e.g., `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("models:/vibration_anomaly_isolationforest/1")`). Remember to also load any associated preprocessing artifacts, such as scalers.
