- **OR-Tools Dependency**: Added to pyproject.toml for future advanced optimization
- **Mock Services**: Dummy CalendarService and mock_technicians list implemented
- **Greedy Assignment Logic**: Simple but effective scheduling algorithm implemented
- **Logging & Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and robust error handling throughout

### ✅ Advanced Features Implemented
- **Optimization Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm for technician assignment
- **Skill Matching**: Technician skills validation against equipment requirements
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Handles scheduling conflicts and resource limitations
- **Calendar Integration**: Mock external calendar service for realistic scheduling
- **Priority-Based Scheduling**: Maintenance task prioritization based on urgency and confidence
- **Health Monitoring**: Full agent lifecycle and health status reporting

## 🏗️ Architecture Integration
