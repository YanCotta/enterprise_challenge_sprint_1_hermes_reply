## System Components

1. **API Gateway (FastAPI)**
2. **Database (PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB)**
3. **Event Bus (In-memory)**
4. **ML Models**

## STRIDE Analysis

### 1. Spoofing (Pretending to be someone/something you're not)

- **Threat:** An unauthorized actor sends data to the `/ingest` endpoint, corrupting the dataset.
- **Mitigation:** The API enforces `X-API-Key` authentication on sensitive endpoints. Scopes are used to ensure keys have the correct permissions.

### 2. Tampering (Modifying data)

- **Threat:** An attacker injects malicious or malformed data into an ML model payload to cause a crash or incorrect prediction.
- **Mitigation:** All incoming data is validated using Pydantic models, which cast types and reject malformed payloads. Input validation will be added for ML features.

### 3. Repudiation (Claiming you didn't do something)

- **Threat:** An operation is performed, but there is no sufficient log to prove who initiated it.
- **Mitigation:** All API requests are logged with a unique `correlation_id`. The API key used for a request can be logged to trace actions back to a specific client.

### 4. Information Disclosure (Exposing information to unauthorized users)

- **Threat:** Error messages leak internal system details (e.g., stack traces, database schema).
- **Mitigation:** FastAPI is configured to not send detailed exception information in production. The database is isolated on a private Docker network and is not exposed to the public internet.

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)

- **Threat:** An attacker spams the compute-intensive `/predict` endpoint, overloading the server.
- **Mitigation:** Rate limiting will be implemented (Day 16) to throttle requests on a per-key and global basis.

### 6. Elevation of Privilege

- **Threat:** A user with a read-only API key finds a way to perform a write operation.
- **Mitigation:** FastAPI dependencies enforce API key scopes on a per-endpoint basis, ensuring a key for `reports:generate` cannot be used for `data:ingest`.

## Security Audit - August 29, 2025

A comprehensive security audit was completed on August 29, 2025, using the Security Audit Checklist framework. The audit covered all system components, API endpoints, and security controls.

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Authentication mechanisms verified and functioning correctly
- ✅ Input validation via Pydantic models confirmed secure
- ✅ Database isolation and SQL injection prevention measures verified
- ✅ Error handling properly configured for production environments
- ✅ Rate limiting implementation confirmed operational
- ✅ Audit logging and correlation ID tracking verified
- ✅ Container security and network isolation confirmed

**Status:** All critical security controls are verified to be in place and functioning as designed. The system maintains a robust security posture with comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities.
