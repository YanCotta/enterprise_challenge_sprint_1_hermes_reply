### Smoke Test Results

#### Overall: ✅ PASS

```json
{
  "ingest": {
    "status": "warn",
    "latency_ms": 4.0,
    "note": "Eventual consistency - expected behavior"
  },
  "prediction": {
    "status": "ok",
    "latency_ms": 719.4,
    "model_version": "1"
  },
  "decision": {

```

### API Endpoints Tested

- ✅ `/health` - 200 OK
- ✅ `/health/db` - Connected
- ✅ `/health/redis` - Connected
- ✅ `/api/v1/data/ingest` - Event published
- ✅ `/api/v1/ml/predict` - Prediction working (auto version resolution)
- ✅ `/api/v1/decisions/submit` - Decision recorded
- ✅ `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics available
- ✅ `/api/v1/sensors/readings` - Data retrieval working
- ✅ `/api/v1/demo/golden-path` - Demo starts successfully

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Prediction Latency | <2000ms | 719ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Decision Write | <5000ms | 1110ms | ✅ Good |
| Health Check | <500ms | <100ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Metrics Endpoint | <1000ms | 2.3ms | ✅ Excellent |

## ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Ingestion Verification Lag
- **Status:** Expected/Documented
- **Impact:** None (asynchronous processing working as designed)
- **Details:** Smoke test shows "warn" status because verification query doesn't immediately find the persisted reading due to eventual consistency. The event is successfully published and processed by the agent system.

### 2. Missing SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
- **Status:** Expected
- **Impact:** None (Slack notifications optional in V1.0)
- **Action:** No action required

## ✅ Phase 1 Validation Checklist

From `docs/V1_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`:

### Environment Preparation
- ✅ `.env` file populated with production credentials
- ✅ Docker daemon running
- ✅ Docker Compose v2 installed
- ✅ Network connectivity verified

### Container Health Checks
- ✅ Build Services (completed prior to validation)
- ✅ Start Stack (all services up)
- ✅ Verify Service Health (all healthy)

### Backend API Smoke Tests
- ✅ Run Automated Smoke Test (passed)
- ✅ Data Ingestion (working, verification shows eventual consistency)
- ✅ Prediction with Auto Version (working)
- ✅ Decision Submission (working)

## 🚀 Next Steps - Phase 2: UI Manual Testing

**Your Task:** Comprehensive UI validation using the browser

### Priority Testing Order

1. **Critical Path Pages** (Test First)
   - Golden Path Demo (with and without decision stage)
   - Prediction Page (forecast + maintenance scheduling)
   - Data Explorer (pagination, filters, export)
   - Decision Log (create, list, filter, export)

2. **Supporting Pages**
   - Simulation Console (all 3 tabs)
   - Model Metadata
   - Metrics Overview
   - Reporting Prototype
   - Debug Page

### How to Test

1. **Open UI**: http://localhost:8501

2. **Follow the checklist**: `docs/V1_DEPLOYMENT_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` Section 4 (UI Functional Tests)

3. **Report Issues**: For each page, note:
   - ✅ What works
   - ❌ Any errors (with screenshot/error message)
   - ⚠️ Any unexpected behavior

4. **Focus Areas** (from recent fixes):
   - Golden Path: Should complete <90s with decision stage
   - Prediction: "Create Maintenance Order" should keep confirmation visible
   - Simulation: All 3 tabs should work without TypeError
   - Reporting: JSON downloads should be prettified

## 📋 Quick Commands for Testing

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
cd smart-maintenance-saas
docker compose logs api --tail=50
docker compose logs ui --tail=50
```

### Re-run Smoke Test
```bash
docker compose exec -T api python scripts/smoke_v1.py
```

### Restart Services (if needed)
```bash
docker compose restart api ui
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
docker compose ps
```

## ✨ Conclusion

**Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

The backend is production-ready. All critical API endpoints are functional, performance is within targets, and automated smoke tests pass successfully. The only "warning" is the expected eventual consistency behavior in ingestion verification, which is documented and does not impact functionality.

**Ready to proceed to Phase 2: UI Manual Testing**

Once UI validation is complete, we'll move to:
- Phase 3: Documentation finalization & VM deployment prep
- Phase 4: Production deployment & final validation
