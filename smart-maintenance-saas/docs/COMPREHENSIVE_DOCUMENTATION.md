# Comprehensive Documentation Index (V1.0 Consolidated)

**Status:** Active (V1.0 Production Ready)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03
**Purpose:** Navigational index to long-lived documentation for operating, extending, and auditing the Smart Maintenance SaaS platform.

> **AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE** → [V1.0 Deployment Playbook](./v1_release_must_do.md) is the canonical reference for V1.0 scope, readiness status, task tracking, and deployment procedures. It replaces the former Prioritized Backlog, V1 Readiness Checklist, and audit markdown files.

**System Architecture:** For comprehensive visual guides of the system, see [SYSTEM_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md Section 2](./SYSTEM_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md#2-system-architecture-visualizations) which includes 14+ detailed diagrams covering all major components.

## 10. Deprecated / Superseded (Reference Only)

The following documents have been **consolidated into the V1.0 Deployment Playbook** and should not be referenced:

- ❌ Prioritized Backlog (merged into v1_release_must_do.md Section 4)
- ❌ V1 Readiness Checklist (merged into v1_release_must_do.md Sections 1, 10)
- ❌ System Capabilities & UI Redesign standalone doc (content distributed across playbook and changelogs)
- ❌ Standalone must-do checklists (consolidated into playbook task board)
- ❌ Legacy audit markdown files (findings merged into playbook Section 9)
- ❌ Old multi-part architecture deep dives (consolidated)
- ❌ Interim anomaly detection notes (merged into technical docs)
- ❌ Early planning scratch files (archived or deleted)

**Migration Note:** If you find references to these files, update them to point to the V1.0 Deployment Playbook or the appropriate legacy archive location.

## 11. How to Maintain This Index

| Action | Trigger | Owner | SLA |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| Add new doc link | New persistent reference doc added | Tech Lead | < 24h |
| Remove stale link | File deleted or merged into unified doc | Any Contributor | Immediate |
| Revalidate cross-links | Quarterly or major release | Documentation Owner | Quarterly |
| Sync with Unified Doc | Structural shift in system scope | Tech Lead | Within sprint |

## 12. Quick Cross-Link Integrity Checklist

- [x] All relative links resolve (manual or CI doc link checker)
- [x] No references to deleted interim analysis files
- [x] Performance section reflects latest validated run
- [x] Security checklist still aligned with deployed architecture
- [x] Authoritative V1.0 scope documentation referenced correctly
