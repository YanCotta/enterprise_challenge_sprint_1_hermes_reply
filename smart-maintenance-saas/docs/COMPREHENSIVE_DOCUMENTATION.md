# Comprehensive Documentation Index (V1.0 Consolidated)

**Status:** Active (V1.0 Minimal Scope - 94.5% Readiness)  
**Last Synchronized:** 2025-12-19  
**Purpose:** This file serves as a navigational index to the retained, long-lived documentation set required for operating, extending, and auditing the Smart Maintenance SaaS platform post V1.0.

> **AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES** → Refer to the [V1_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md](./V1_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md), [EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md](./EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md), and [SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES_AND_UI_REDESIGN.md](./SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES_AND_UI_REDESIGN.md) for the consolidated system state, V1.0 scope, and deferred features tracking.

## 8. Event & Agent Framework
- Event and agent framework details are documented in [SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES_AND_UI_REDESIGN.md](./SYSTEM_CAPABILITIES_AND_UI_REDESIGN.md) - authoritative system capabilities matrix.

## 9. Historical / Legacy Documentation
- [Legacy Documentation Index](./legacy/INDEX.md) – Archived historical documents
- Historical sprint logs and superseded docs have been moved to `docs/legacy/` directory

## 10. Deprecated / Removed (Not Reintroduced)
The following prior analysis or interim documents were intentionally consolidated or removed to reduce duplication and drift risk:
- Old multi-part architecture deep dives (merged)
- Interim anomaly detection notes (merged)
- Early planning scratch files

## 11. How to Maintain This Index
| Action | Trigger | Owner | SLA |
|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| Add new doc link | New persistent reference doc added | Tech Lead | < 24h |
| Remove stale link | File deleted or merged into unified doc | Any Contributor | Immediate |
| Revalidate cross-links | Quarterly or major release | Documentation Owner | Quarterly |
| Sync with Unified Doc | Structural shift in system scope | Tech Lead | Within sprint |

## 12. Quick Cross-Link Integrity Checklist
- [x] All relative links resolve (manual or CI doc link checker)
- [x] No references to deleted interim analysis files
- [x] Performance section reflects latest validated run
- [x] Security checklist still aligned with deployed architecture
- [x] Authoritative V1.0 scope documentation referenced correctly

### Change Log (for this file only)
| Date | Change | Author |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2025-09-25 | Initial creation of consolidated index replacing legacy comprehensive doc variant | AI Assistant |
| 2025-12-19 | Fixed broken UNIFIED_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md references; updated to reflect V1.0 scope and legacy archival | AI Assistant |

---
**Principle:** Minimize duplication. Deep content belongs in the unified doc or the domain-specific file; this index points, it doesn’t repeat.
