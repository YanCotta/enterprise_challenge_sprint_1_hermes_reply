# Prioritized V1.0+ Enhancement Backlog

## Executive Priority Matrix

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Business Impact**: User value and operational efficiency
- **Technical Risk**: Implementation complexity and stability risk
- **Effort**: Development time and testing requirements
- **Dependencies**: Blocking factors and integration requirements

## Priority 1: Critical (Address Immediately if Resources Available)

### 1. Real-time Metrics Streaming Dashboard
**Problem**: Current metrics display is snapshot-based with manual refresh, limiting operational visibility.

**Proposed Solution**: 
- Implement WebSocket/SSE endpoint for live metric updates
- Add auto-refresh toggle with 5s/15s/30s intervals
- Provide delta highlighting for changed values

**Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Medium - Operators may miss critical system state changes
**Dependencies**: None - can implement incrementally

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
# Add streaming endpoint in apps/api/routers/metrics.py  
@router.websocket("/metrics/stream")
async def stream_metrics(websocket: WebSocket):
    # Send periodic metric updates
    
# Update ui/pages/6_Metrics_Overview.py with WebSocket client
```

### 2. Report Artifact Generation and Download
**Problem**: Reports generate JSON output but lack persistent storage and downloadable artifacts.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add file storage backend (local filesystem or S3)
- Implement PDF generation for comprehensive reports
- Add download endpoints with proper MIME types

**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: High - Essential for audit compliance and operational handoffs
**Dependencies**: File storage configuration

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
# Enhance apps/api/routers/reporting.py
@router.get("/download/{report_id}")
async def download_report(report_id: str):
    return FileResponse(path=report_path, media_type="application/pdf")
```

## Priority 2: High (Plan for V1.1 Release)

### 3. Enhanced Test Coverage for Core Workflows  
**Problem**: Limited automated test coverage for critical user paths.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add integration tests for ingestion â†’ retrieval round-trip
- Validate prediction auto-resolve with various model versions
- Test decision log filtering, pagination, and CSV export
- Simulate golden path orchestration with timeout scenarios

**Effort**: Small (1-2 days)  
**Risk if Deferred**: Medium - Potential regression introduction during future changes
**Dependencies**: Test environment with mock MLflow registry

### 4. Background SHAP Processing Pipeline
**Problem**: SHAP explanations can take 30+ seconds, blocking UI interaction.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Implement async job queue (Celery/Redis or FastAPI BackgroundTasks)
- Add job status polling endpoint
- Cache SHAP results with model version keys  
- Provide progress indicator in UI

**Effort**: Large (5-7 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Low - SHAP is optional feature, users can disable it
**Dependencies**: Job queue infrastructure, result caching strategy

### 5. Bulk Data Operations Enhancement
**Problem**: Only single-record ingestion supported; no bulk import/export capabilities.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add CSV upload endpoint with chunked processing
- Implement batch prediction API for multiple readings
- Provide progress tracking for long-running bulk operations
- Add export capabilities for large datasets

**Effort**: Medium (3-4 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Medium - Limits operational efficiency for large-scale data management
**Dependencies**: File upload handling, progress tracking UI components

## Priority 3: Medium (V1.2+ Enhancement Candidates)

### 6. Advanced Multi-Sensor Correlation Analytics
**Problem**: Current analysis focuses on single sensors; complex equipment needs multi-sensor insights.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add cross-sensor correlation matrix visualization
- Implement composite anomaly scoring across sensor groups
- Provide equipment-level health dashboards
- Add predictive failure modeling with multiple input sources

**Effort**: Large (7-10 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Low - Single-sensor analysis covers primary use cases
**Dependencies**: Enhanced data model, visualization libraries

### 7. Model Recommendations Caching and Virtualization
**Problem**: Model recommendation queries have latency issues; UI enumeration not optimized.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Implement intelligent caching layer for model recommendations
- Add UI virtualization for large model lists
- Provide model performance comparison tools
- Add automated A/B testing framework for model selection

**Effort**: Medium (4-5 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Low - Current model selection works for existing model count
**Dependencies**: Enhanced MLflow metadata extraction

## Priority 4: Low (Nice-to-Have Features)

### 8. Advanced Notification System UI
**Problem**: Alert agents exist in backend but no UI for viewing/configuring notifications.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add notification history viewer
- Implement channel configuration (email, Slack, webhook)
- Provide alert rule management interface
- Add notification test/preview capabilities

**Effort**: Medium (3-4 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Very Low - Backend alerts function without UI
**Dependencies**: Notification channel integrations

### 9. Feature Store Visualization and Lineage
**Problem**: No visibility into model feature lineage, drift correlation displays.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add feature importance visualization
- Implement feature drift tracking over time
- Provide model lineage graphs
- Add feature store health monitoring

**Effort**: Large (6-8 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Very Low - Advanced MLOps capability beyond core requirements  
**Dependencies**: Enhanced MLflow integration, graph visualization components

### 10. Governance and Retention Policies
**Problem**: No lifecycle policies for generated reports, model artifacts, or historical data.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add configurable data retention policies
- Implement automatic artifact cleanup
- Provide data archival and restoration capabilities
- Add compliance reporting for data governance

**Effort**: Medium (4-5 days)
**Risk if Deferred**: Very Low - Manual cleanup sufficient for initial operations
**Dependencies**: Storage management framework, compliance requirements definition
