## Full-Stack Audit Report: smart-maintenance-saas

### Critical

**1. API Path Mismatch in Data Explorer**

*   **File:** `smart-maintenance-saas/ui/pages/1_data_explorer.py`
*   **Finding:** The Data Explorer page makes API calls to `/api/v1/sensors/sensors` and `/api/v1/sensors/readings`. However, the FastAPI router in `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/api/routers/sensor_readings.py` defines these routes as `/sensors` and `/readings`. The FastAPI application's prefix is likely `/api/v1/sensors`, which means the UI is calling the wrong paths.
*   **Impact:** The Data Explorer page will fail to load any sensor data, rendering it non-functional.
*   **Recommendation:** The UI should be updated to call the correct API endpoints. However, since the API router paths are inconsistent with the other routers, the best solution is to modify the router to include the full path.
*   **Validation:** Once the fix is implemented, manually test the Data Explorer page in the Streamlit UI to confirm that sensor readings are loaded correctly.

### High

**1. Missing Error Handling in Data Explorer**

*   **File:** `smart-maintenance-saas/ui/pages/1_data_explorer.py`
*   **Finding:** The API call to fetch the list of sensors for the filter dropdown does not have any error handling. If the API call fails, the dropdown will be empty, and the user will not be notified of the error.
*   **Impact:** Poor user experience and confusion when the sensor list fails to load.
*   **Recommendation:** Add a `try...except` block around the `make_api_request` call for fetching the sensor list. If the call fails, display an error message to the user using `st.error()`.
*   **Validation:** Manually test the Data Explorer page and simulate an API failure for the sensor list endpoint to verify that a user-friendly error message is displayed.

**2. Missing Input Validation in Decision Log**

*   **Files:** `smart-maintenance-saas/ui/pages/2_decision_log.py` and `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/api/routers/human_decision.py`
*   **Finding:** The form for submitting a new human decision has basic frontend checks, but the backend API endpoint at `/api/v1/decisions/submit` does not perform any validation on the incoming payload.
*   **Impact:** The application is vulnerable to invalid or malicious data being submitted, which could lead to data corruption or application errors.
*   **Recommendation:** Implement Pydantic model validation in the `submit_decision` endpoint in `human_decision.py` to validate the incoming `DecisionResponse` payload.
*   **Validation:** Write a unit test for the `/api/v1/decisions/submit` endpoint that sends an invalid payload and asserts that a 422 Unprocessable Entity error is returned.

**3. Hardcoded API Base URL**

*   **File:** `smart-maintenance-saas/ui/lib/api_client.py`
*   **Finding:** The `API_BASE_URL` in the `api_client.py` defaults to `http://api:8000`. This is not suitable for a production environment where the API might be exposed at a different address.
*   **Impact:** The UI will not be able to connect to the API in a production environment without code changes.
*   **Recommendation:** Remove the hardcoded default and rely solely on environment variables to configure the `API_BASE_URL`. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to pass the correct URL to the UI container.
*   **Validation:** After the change, run the UI and API services using `docker-compose` and verify that the UI can successfully communicate with the API.

### Medium

**1. Mocked Services and Data**

*   **Files:** `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/agents/decision/scheduling_agent.py`, `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/agents/decision/reporting_agent.py`
*   **Finding:** The `SchedulingAgent` and `ReportingAgent` rely on mocked services (`CalendarService`, `AnalyticsEngine`) and hardcoded data (a list of mock technicians).
*   **Impact:** The scheduling and reporting features of the application are not functional in their current state and will produce placeholder data.
*   **Recommendation:** Replace the mocked services and data with integrations to real services and a database for storing technician data.
*   **Validation:** Once the real implementations are in place, write integration tests to verify that the scheduling and reporting agents can successfully interact with the real services and data.

**2. Inconsistent API Endpoint Organization**

*   **Files:** `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/api/routers/decisions.py`, `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/api/routers/human_decision.py`
*   **Finding:** The endpoints for retrieving and submitting human decisions are split across two different files, which is confusing and inconsistent with the other routers.
*   **Impact:** This makes the code harder to maintain and understand.
*   **Recommendation:** Consolidate the decision-related endpoints into a single file, `decisions.py`.
*   **Validation:** After refactoring, run the application and test the Decision Log page to ensure that both retrieving and submitting decisions still work as expected.

**3. Non-functional Linting Setup**

*   **File:** `smart-maintenance-saas/pyproject.toml`
*   **Finding:** The project is configured to use several linting tools (`flake8`, `black`, `mypy`, etc.), but I was unable to run them in the containerized environment. This is likely due to a misconfiguration in the Docker setup or the tool invocation.
*   **Impact:** The inability to automatically enforce code style and quality increases the risk of introducing bugs and makes the code harder to maintain.
*   **Recommendation:** Investigate the Docker configuration for the `ml` service and the commands used to run the linters to identify and fix the misconfiguration.
*   **Validation:** Once the fix is in place, run the linting tools from the `Makefile` or directly with `docker compose run` and verify that they execute successfully.

### Low

**1. Hardcoded Agent Settings**

*   **File:** `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/system_coordinator.py`
*   **Finding:** The `SystemCoordinator` has hardcoded settings for the various agents. This makes it difficult to reconfigure the agents without modifying the code.
*   **Impact:** Reduced flexibility and increased difficulty in managing agent configurations.
*   **Recommendation:** Externalize the agent settings to a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) or environment variables.
*   **Validation:** After externalizing the settings, modify a setting in the configuration and verify that the agent's behavior changes accordingly.

**2. In-memory Event Feed**

*   **File:** `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/system_coordinator.py`
*   **Finding:** The `SystemCoordinator` uses an in-memory deque to store the maintenance schedule feed. This data will be lost if the application restarts.
*   **Impact:** The UI will not be able to display historical maintenance schedules after a restart.
*   **Recommendation:** Replace the in-memory deque with a persistent storage solution, such as a Redis stream or a dedicated database table.
*   **Validation:** After implementing a persistent store, restart the application and verify that the maintenance schedule history is still available.

## Assumptions and Outstanding Questions

*   I have assumed that the `AGENTS.md` file does not exist in the repository, as I did not find one during my exploration.
*   I was unable to verify the database migrations, as I did not have access to the database. It is crucial to ensure that the Alembic migrations are up-to-date with the ORM models.
*   It is unclear how secrets and sensitive configurations (e.g., database passwords, API keys) are managed in a production environment. The use of a `.env` file is not secure for production.
