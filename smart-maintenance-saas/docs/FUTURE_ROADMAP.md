## Final Implementation Plan: Smart Maintenance SaaS


### **Day 1 Monitoring & Redis Resilience**
* **Focus:** Bolster production-ready claims with professional monitoring and improved fault tolerance.
* **Objective:** Integrate Prometheus for application monitoring and configure Redis for high availability.

#### **Step-by-Step Tasks**
1.  **Integrate Prometheus Monitoring (2 hours):**
    * Add `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` to `pyproject.toml`.
    * In `smart-maintenance-saas/apps/api/main.py`, import `Instrumentator` and instrument the app to expose a `/metrics` endpoint.
    * Update `docker-compose.yml` to add a `prometheus` service and a placeholder for `grafana`.
2.  **Enhance Redis Resilience (1-2 hours):**
    * In `docker-compose.yml`, update the Redis configuration to use a basic high-availability setup with a master and a sentinel.
    * Document the failover strategy in a new `docs/SCALABILITY.md` file.

#### **Copilot Prompt**
"Integrate Prometheus metrics into the FastAPI app in `apps/api/main.py` using `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`. Then, update the `docker-compose.yml` file to add Prometheus and Grafana services. Finally, modify the Docker Compose Redis setup to include a Sentinel for failover."

### **Day 2: Deployment Preparation**
* **Focus:** Prepare for a polished, professional, and always-on public demo.
* **Objective:** Deploy the backend services and the user interface to modern cloud platforms.

#### **Step-by-Step Tasks**
1.  **Finalize Docker Configuration (1 hour):** Ensure the `docker-compose.yml` file and associated Dockerfiles are clean and production-ready.
2.  **Deploy Backend to Render (2 hours):** Create a new Web Service on Render for the FastAPI backend. Configure it to build from your Git repository and set up all necessary environment variables.
3.  **Deploy UI to Vercel (2 hours):** Create a new project on Vercel for the Streamlit UI. Point it to your repository and configure the backend API URL as an environment variable.
4.  **End-to-End Testing (1 hour):** Thoroughly test the live application, especially the live demo simulator, to ensure the UI and backend are communicating correctly.
