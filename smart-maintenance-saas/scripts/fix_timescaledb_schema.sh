TimescaleDB Schema Fix Script - Professional Recovery

This script addresses the recurring SQLAlchemy primary key conflict that occurs
due to TimescaleDB hypertable constraints preventing primary key modifications
through standard Alembic migrations.

ISSUE: SQLAlchemy warns about primary key mismatch between ORM model and database schema:
- Database: composite primary key (timestamp, sensor_id) - required by TimescaleDB
- ORM: expects single primary key on id column

SOLUTION: Apply the historical Day 15/21 fix to ensure sequence is properly configured
while maintaining TimescaleDB hypertable compatibility.

This script is automatically executed during container startup to ensure consistency.
